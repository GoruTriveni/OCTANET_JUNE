ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project at Octanet Services Pvt. Ltd. â€“ a Coffee Landing Page! â˜•

I've been working on creating an engaging and user-friendly landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my skills in web development, from structuring content with HTML, styling with CSS, to adding interactive elements with JavaScript.

The landing page includes several sections such as Home, About, Blogs, Reviews, Menu, and Contact pages to provide a comprehensive and seamless user experience.
